    All the models are  pmx format. (other formats are still being explored)

​    Part of the models are published in aplaybox by Genshin impact official. Others are made or extracted by capable players.

​    Thus it's only a carry for people who are inconvenient to register or read Chinese in this website.

The structure of this directory:

- Aplaybox: just some simple models by aplaybox. (BTW) 

- Asoul: some models of a vtb team called asoul.

- CharacterByMihoyo: official models published by mihoyo,

  also included are a few models modified by players.

- NPC: npc models.

- Scene: game scenes such as jade chamber.

- Weapon: weapon models.

- Inventory: some props.



**BTW:** aplaybox.com is the only way that hoyoverse publish it's character model that I found. And I have tried several days to find a website that hoyoverse publish it's models in English for those who are not familiar with Chinese. I shall provide English version of this models in the near future.

Nevertheless therer are some English websites that I found useful:

<a href=https://gamesfashionarchive.net/viewer/Genshin_Impact>Gamefashion</a>(an amazing website, but don't provide model download )
